As a rankings manager I can edit a player result

As a rankings manager I can regularly scan the EMA website for newly completed tournaments and import their data

- http://mahjong-europe.org/ranking/Tournament/Tournaments_2025.html and similarly for other years
- Tournament metadata and player scores
- Only need to import UK player scores
- Number of hanchan can be defaulted as 4 \* number of days
- To occur once a week at a given time
- Consider recording a marker that a tournament was processed and found to contain no UK data

As a rankings manager I can seed the website with tournament data from the last 2 years
